* Flow TodoMVC example

This is a larger-scale example application for Flow based on the
[[http://todomvc.com/][TodoMVC]] project.

All of the concepts here have already been introduced in the [[https://github.com/james-henderson/flow/tree/0.2.0-branch/samples][tutorials]]
or [[https://github.com/james-henderson/flow][README]] - have a look at these if you're unsure about any of the
code:

To start the TodoMVC application, clone this repository, 'cd' to
'samples/todomvc', and run =lein dev=. You should then see a web
service start at http://localhost:3000!

Any questions, please let me know!
